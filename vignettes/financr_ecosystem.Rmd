Other `'R packages'` retrieves data from Yahoo Finance, and thus have the same source as `'financr'`. E.g., [`'yahoofinancer'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yahoofinancer), [`'quantmod'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=quantmod) and the packages that depends on them such as [`'yfr'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yfR) and [`'stocks'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stocks) that depends on `'quantmod'`. 

`'financr'` only retrieves data from Yahoo Finance, without assumptions about the visualizations or analyses performed with these financial data. Consequently, `'financr'` dependencies are kept low. Other packages could offers more advanced methods, for example, `'quantmod'` offers financial data-analysis oriented functions and time series data visualization methods.

`'financr'` functions always return a standardized `data.frame`. For example, `financr::get_historic()` return a standard `data.frame` while `'yahoofinancer'` methods return an `'R6'` class object (e.g., `Ticker$get_history`) ; `quantmod::getSymbols()` return a `'xts'` & `'zoo'` time series object ; and `yfr::yf_get()` return a tibble.
