Other `'R packages'` retrieves data from Yahoo Finance and have the same source as `'financr'`, e.g., [`'yahoofinancer'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yahoofinancer), [`'quantmod'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=quantmod). Similarly for packages that depends on them, e.g., [`'yfr'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yfR), and [`'stocks'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stocks) that both depends on `'quantmod'`. 


> `'financr'` dependencies are kept low. Therefore other packages sometimes offers more advanced methods, e.g., `'quantmod'` offers financial data-analysis oriented functions and time series data visualization methods, `'yfr'` handle large-scale downloads.

> `'financr'` only retrieves data from Yahoo Finance, without assumptions about the visualizations or analyses performed with these financial data.

Regarding the historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance API, `financr::get_historic()` return a standard `data.frame` (all `'financr'` functions return a `data.frame`) vs. `'yahoofinancer'` methods return an `'R6'` class object, `quantmod::getSymbols()` return a `'xts'` & `'zoo'` time series object, etc.
